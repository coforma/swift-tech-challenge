# Post-MVP Ecosystem Design Thinking

To iterate on our MVP designs, we focused on items in our prioritization matrix that held high user value but brought additional implementation challenges over a short timeframe:


## The Authenticated Experience



1. **Account creation**: Students may want to manage their college search and application process within just one website. Allowing users to create accounts and store their data encourages students to make smart return visits.

2. **Saving colleges to a list**: Students may want to save colleges to a list that they can edit and continue to add to over time.

3. **Tracking applications**: Students who have submitted applications to different colleges may benefit from application status tracking, which would allow students to view which applications are in-progress, submitted, and unfinished.

## Support for First-Generation College Students

Students first in their family to go to college face additional obstacles in attending. The application and enrollment process is unintuitive and a lack of clarity regarding costs and financial aid can cause confusion. After launching the initial functionality, we’d like to focus on supporting this population with additional tools and content. This functionality could have the added benefit of exposing any student to college options and aspects of choice they hadn’t considered.



1. **Guided ‘College match’ quiz: **There is an incredible amount of data about colleges for students to parse through as they compare options. While we did restrict our filters to a set we thought might be most useful, we also think a guided walkthrough of a few of the filters, structured as a ‘My College Matches’ quiz, might be helpful.

2. **Viewing net cost by income level on list page**: College costs can be so confusing! We made an assumption that students and families would be unlikely to understand the nuances of many of the cost fields provided, and thus looked for ways to simplify or explain in the tool post-MVP. We considered that for students from low-income backgrounds, the average net cost might be VERY different from the average cost for students from all income levels. We explored a tool that could display the average cost for a specific income bracket on the college card by asking a user to simply select their income bracket. We would definitely want to test this with users, because there is a risk that students and families could be even more confused.

3. **Static content about applying and financial aid**: Students who do not have an accurate mental model of how college
