# 12. use-code-ql

Date: 2024-03-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to proactively monitor and maintain security of code. GitHub's CodeQL is a semantic code analysis engine that performs static application security testing (SAST), an important part of code security.

## Decision

Utilize CodeQL for static code scanning.

## Consequences

Developers will be able to monitor and maintain code security from directly within the repository interface.
