Date: 2024-03-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Integration tests generally test a combination of components working together
as part of the app and focus on their behavior/functionality as a group.
Cypress is a best-in-class end-to-end test runner with lots of additional
integrations we can use to ensure our application is well-tested throughout.

## Decision

Install and use Cypress and related tools for integration and end-to-end testing.

## Consequences

Cypress will be installed as a testing tool and will be available for developers
when writing integration and end-to-end tests.
