Date: 2024-03-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

How do we ensure commits are from a trusted source since we are developing in the open with potential open source concepts in the future.

## Decision

We're going to use signed commits for this repository to ensure all commits come from a trusted source as recommended by 18f

## Consequences

Initial user setup takes a few extra minutes but provides extra security
