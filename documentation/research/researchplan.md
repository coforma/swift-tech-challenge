## RESEARCH PLAN

### Design Research Goals

We will conduct design research activities with first-time prospective college students aged 15-25 to understand their needs, desires, and mental models related to finding and applying to college. We are looking to learn:



* How prospective students think about the college application process:
    * What they anticipate the experience will be like, and how it works (aka, the mental model)
    * What pain points they forsee for themselves or peers
    * What their need, goals, and fears are
    * Other tools they use to accomplish college-related tasks
    * What motivates and demotivates them related to applying to college - functionally, emotionally and socially
* How effective our MVP is at helping students meet their needs related to:
    * Finding colleges that might be a good fit
    * Applying for those colleges
* How students would rate and prioritize post-MVP features like saving colleges, tracking applications, and the college/financial aid quiz.


### Methodology

We propose 60-minute, 1:1 interviews with students. They could follow this general format:



* Part 1: Open ended questions 
* Part 2: Usability testing session 
* Part 3: Concept testing session

In a **usability-testing session**, a researcher asks a participant to perform tasks, usually using one or more specific user interfaces. While the participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback.

A **concept testing session** involves collecting users’ thoughts and attitudes about a product idea (“concept”) in its early stages, usually through a qualitative survey or interview. It is used very early in the discovery phase of the design process to understand whether a specific product idea meets users’ needs and expectations.


### Outcome

Our learnings will inform content and visual enhancements along with metrics  to the measure effectivity, ensuring that we are building for the right mental model, and help us build out a roadmap for the product’s future.


### Recruitment Approach

Since we’re focusing on first-time college applicants, our primary source of students would likely be highschools or programs for high-school aged students (like community-based organizations, college prep programs, etc). We would prioritize speaking with students from underserved communities, or those who may need more support overcoming systemic obstacles to college.

We might also invite a few adults from advocacy organization that could help us understand the landscape of college applications and financial aid.

Our recruitment methods would be determined in collaboration with DoE stakeholders.


### Next steps



* Research plan adjustment and approval with stakeholders
* Flesh out recruitment plan
* Create moderator guide
