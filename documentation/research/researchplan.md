## RESEARCH PLAN

### Research Goals

We will conduct design research activities with first-time prospective college students aged 15-25 to understand their needs, desires, and mental models related to finding and applying to college. We are looking to learn:

* Understand how prospective students think about the college application process:
   * What are their needs, goals, and fears?
   * What do they anticipate the experience might be like, how it works, and what they might do? (Understanding their mental model and approach)
   * What pain points do they foresee for themselves and people around them?
   * What tools do they use to accomplish college-related tasks?
   * What motivates and demotivates them related to applying to college - functionally, emotionally and socially?
* Understand effectivity of our MVP at helping students meet their needs related to:
   * Finding colleges that might be a good fit
   * Applying for those colleges
* Understand how students would rate and prioritize post-MVP features like saving colleges, tracking applications, and the college/financial aid quiz.
   * Learn more about what we might have missed


### Methodology

We propose 60-minute, 1:1 interviews with students. They could follow this general format:

* Part 1: Open ended questions 
* Part 2: Usability testing session 
* Part 3: Concept testing session

In a **usability-testing session**, a researcher asks a participant to perform tasks, usually using one or more specific user interfaces. While the participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant’s behavior and listens for feedback.

A **concept testing session** involves collecting users’ thoughts and attitudes about a product idea (“concept”) in its early stages, usually through a qualitative survey or interview. It is used very early in the discovery phase of the design process to understand whether a specific product idea meets users’ needs and expectations.


### Outcome

Our learnings will:
* Inform content and visual enhancements along with metrics  to measure effectivity, ensuring that we are building the right features for our users. 
* Help prioritize and plan out a roadmap for the product’s future.



### Recruitment Approach

Since we’re focusing on first-time college applicants, our primary source of students would likely be highschools and programs for high-school aged students (like community-based organizations, college prep programs, etc). We would prioritize speaking with students from underserved communities, or those who may need more support overcoming systemic obstacles to college.

Other personas of interest:
* Advocacy organizations that could help us understand the landscape of college applications and financial aid.
* People in an applicant’s support system (family, peers etc)
* College administrators who manage application cycles and information
  
Our recruitment methods would be determined in collaboration with DoE stakeholders.



### Next steps



* Research plan adjustment and approval with stakeholders
* Flesh out recruitment plan
* Create moderator guide
