### Using adr-tools

This repository makes use of [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/tree/master) to record architectural decisions as part of the code base.

There are two uses for this, recording a new decision and superseding an existing decision.

#### Recording a new decision

To create a new decision use the adr new command:

```bash
 adr new Implement as Unix shell scripts
```

#### Superseding an existing decision

To overwrite an existing decision you can add the -s flag followed by which is getting overwritten. In this example we are overwriting decision 9 with an updated decision:

```bash
adr new -s 9 Use Rust for performance-critical functionality
```
